If a file is identified as a virus, it is either logged or not uploaded to the server. The application relies on the underlying ClamAV virus scanning engine, which the admin points Nextcloud to when configuring the application. Alternatively, a Kaspersky Scan Engine can be configured, which has to run on a separate server.\nFor this app to be effective, the ClamAV virus definitions should be kept up to date. Also note that enabling this app will impact system performance as additional processing is required for every upload. More information is available in the Antivirus documentation." : "病毒克星 是适用于 Nextcloud 的反病毒应用。\n\n* 🕵️‍♂️ 用户上载文件时，它将检查\n*☢️ 上传和受感染的文件将被删除，并通过电子邮件显示和/或发送通知\n*🔎 后台作业可扫描所有文件\n*❓ 使用 ClamAV（开源）或 Kaspersky 扫描引擎\n\n此应用程序在将文件上传到 Nextcloud 存储之前，会检查上传到 Nextcloud 的文件是否存在病毒。如果文件被标识为病毒，则该文件将被记录或不上载到服务器。该应用程序依赖于底层 ClamAV 病毒扫描引擎，管理员在配置该应用程序时会将Nextcloud 指向该引擎。或者，可以配置 Kaspersky 扫描引擎，该引擎必须在单独的服务器上运行。\n为了使该应用程序有效，ClamAV 应保持最新。另请注意，启用此应用会影响系统性能，因为每次上传都需要额外的处理。病毒克星文档中提供了更多信息。",
